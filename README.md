# 2D-Random-Walk

A simple and fun project I made trying to simulate a 2D random walk process, similar to how small particles behave.

The main purpose of this project was to implement a locally hosted back-end server in Python using Flask and communicate with the front-end. In this project, the Python
back-end is feeding data to JavaScript in the form of randomly generate x and y values which ultimately decide the directional behaviour of the particle. Although,
I may have gone overboard by setting the fetch interval to 1ms. Can you spot when the gif starts and ends?
